### Launch Chrome for Burp
Prereq: All Chrome instances need to be fully closed(`cmd+q`) before running this, otherwise the settings won't take.
```bash
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --proxy-server=http://localhost:8080 #--ignore-certificate-errors
```
*Note: Ignore certificate errors can be used if you can't install the Burp CA, but it is NOT recommended.*
