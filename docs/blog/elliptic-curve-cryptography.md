# Elliptic Curve Cryptography: Visualized

One of the first classes I took in college was called "Writing for Engineers".  I entered that class with smile on my face - I found it humorous that my university thought engineers needed a specific class on how to write.  Throughout that class we weren't taught how to write, rather how to communicate. I was introduced to new mediums of communication through various assignments and through that was challenged to learn new topics and communicate them clearly.  This is the result of one of those assignments which turned in to my first blog post many years ago.  Here it is.
