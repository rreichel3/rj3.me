# The Great Mental Models - General Thinking Concepts
This book discusses common concepts that we can apply to daily situations in the world around us.  It builds out and encourages one to attempt to better understand the world around them through these frameworks. 

This book was recommended to me by a coworker after a conversation around building out frameworks for solving and approaching problems as well as thinking about things.

## The Map Is Not The Terrain
::: tip Core Concept
Maps are necessary distillations of reality. 
:::

When you see an explanation of something it has necessary simplifications to share the concept. There is likely far more breadth and depth to issues. 

### Concrete Examples
- Subway Map -> Only shows the subway lines, not all of the underground infrastructure such as pipes, etc
- Google Maps -> Doesn't show powerlines, etc because its not an issue for drivers


### Where could this be applied? 

- **News Stories** -> News is necessary distillation of everything happening in the world. If we did record everything that happened we'd need a really good simulation engine :smile:
- **Software Engineering** -> We have simplified models of how software works that, most of the time, ignores abstractions associated with processors, machine code and memory management. 
- **Stories shared** -> If someone is to tell you about their trip to the grocery store, they'll probably skip over parts they deem irrelevant, such as locking or unlocking the door to their home. 
- **Carpentry** -> I don't need to understand _why_ hardwoods behave the way they do, rather a book on carpentry will just describe the properties. 

## Circle of Competence

::: tip Core Concept
You have things you're good at and things you're not. Be aware of that.

Aside: Its ok to not be an expert at everything or to know everything.
:::

### Concrete Example
The book uses the example of a long time resident of a small town contrasted against a traveler.  The long time resident will understand the intricacies of the social dynamics in the town, the impact of the terrain (near a river), etc.  A traveler who stays a day may know the map but not understand everything about the terrain.

The dangerous place is where the Traveler acts like an expert on the town and starts selling next the river which easily floods. 


### Where could this be applied? 
- **What your organization is good at** -> If I work for McDonalds and want to start offering low volume, high cost five start dinners I'm likely outside of my circle of competence. 
- **Ask for help** -> Everyone's going to need help in various places. 
- **Impostor Syndrome** -> If you feel like an impostor its likely because you do understand

## First Principles Thinking

::: tip Core Concept
Get down to the core reasons for why things work the way they do.  Do this by Asking 5 Why's or Socratic Questioning
:::

The idea of first principles is to break down concepts or ideas to their core.  This is incredibly helpful when working and interacting in complex systems. Since these are core facts or ideas about a discipline, they are the underlying pillars in which a discipline is based on. If you understand those, you can derive the rest.

> If you know the first principles of something you can build the rest of your knowledge around them.

> If we never take something apart, test our assumptions about it and reconstruct it we end up bound by what other people tell us. 

The book provides a number of techniques for actually getting to first principles: 

### Socratic Questioning
1. Clarify your thinking and origins of your ideas. _Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?_
2. Challenging assumptions. _How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?_
3. Looking for evidence. _How can I back this up? What are the sources?_
4. Considering alternate perspectives. _What might others think? How do I know I am correct?_
5. Examining consequences and implications. _What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?_
6. Questioning with original questions. _Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?_

### Five Whys

Ask yourself `why` 5 times to try and land at the core principles. The goal is _not_ to land on something related to how you feel but rather landing on a what or a how. 

You can tell that you've hit a principle when the answer to `Why` is a fact.  Landing on a "This is just how it is" answer means that its likely not a principle, rather it is a cultural norm. 

### Concrete Example
Robin Warren and Barry Marshall, both Gastroenterologists questioned the long standing medical opinion that there was no bacteria in the stomach after noticing evidence that showed it might exist.  This caused them to rethink stomac ulcers and ultimately discover that `H. pylori` was a cause of stomach ulcers rather than the previously assumed cause: Stress.
### Where could this be applied? 
- **Incident Response** -> When something is going wrong, try to dig into the root cause of the incident. 
- **Corporate Change** -> If a reorg is confusing, try to find (or ask your leadership) about the first principles used to decide new organization structure
- **Home Construction** -> What is necessary for a home? Why?
- **Developing software** -> Is this the best way to do things or just the way we've always done them. 
- **Math** -> If you understand the underlying proofs, you can derive most formulae. For example, if you understand how the proof for a derivative in Calculus, you can, with some effort, derive the formula for every type of derivative. 

## Thought Experiment

::: tip Core Concept
Hypothesize, research then think through outcomes that may happen to gain new insights
:::

A thought experiment is a controlled process you go through to understand potential outcomes without ever having to conduct a physical, real world experiment. Certainly it will have drawbacks since the thoughts aren't tested in the real world however this approach can aid in getting _towards_ the correct answer which, most of the time, is all you need. 

### Steps
The book outlines a few steps that ensure you're rigorously going through the thought experiment and not just throwing a guess at the wall.  
1. Ask a question
2. Conduct background research
3. Construct hypothesis
4. Test with (thought) experiments
5. Analyze outcomes and draw conclusions
6. Compare to hypothesis and adjust accordingly (new question, etc)

### Concrete Example
In a hypthetical game of 1-on-1 basketball where LeBron James and Woody Allen go up against each other, who do you think would win? Why? 

Now, think about a hypothetical game between LeBron James and Kevin Durant - Who would win? Why?  

Your answers to these are running the thought experiment - Most people have enough context to skip the background research step to understand who the players are then they can simulate the outcome in their mind, using the known information about the players. 
### Where could this be applied? 

- **Imagining physical impossibilities** -> Einstein's famous thought experiment regarding being inside an elevator and being unable to distinguish the difference between acceleration from gravtity or another force such as a cable pulling you. 
- **Re-imagining history** -> Enables us to ask the question what would have happened if X had occurred in a different manner.  For example, what if Franz Ferdinand had not been assassinated? Would we have still had WWI? This is useful for _exploring_ unrealized outcomes but need to be careful because the system of history is endlessly complex. Also, remember when doing research here: [The Map is Not the Terrain](./#the-map-is-not-the-terrain)
- **Intuiting the non-intuitive** -> This enables us to think in ways that are not immediately intuitive to us.  We can switch up the context of the world, for example in the `Veil of Ignorance` theory which suggests that when designing a theoretical society, those designing would have to plan as if they were going to be randomly placed across the society to ensure there it is designed as fairly as possible.  Another way to apply this: If you were designing HR in your company, what policies would you like in place if you weren't didn't know what your role in the company was or anything about who you are? 


## Second Order Thinking
::: tip Core Concept
When considering an action, consider not just the results but the effect those results might have as well
:::

Systems are complicated and they permeate our world.  It is challenging for us to truly understand systems however when we act as if everything exists in a vaccum, we are far more prone to make mistakes or bad decisions. When developing plans, second order thinking can help us to develop potential consequences of actions that occur. 

Note, this concept ties deeply with game theory.  If we perform second order thinking, then we can accurately game out approaches - If we act as if a given game is finite, it may not yield the truly optimal outcome.
### Concrete Example
A great example where second order thinking would have helped is the classic story of Cobras in India.  

The British Government recognized there were far too many Cobras in India so they instituted a bounty for every dead cobra brought to the Government. What was the reaction of the citizens?  They took the simplest approach to profit - They started breeding the cobras.  Ultimately the British Government had to stop the bounty program, leaving more cobras in India than when they started. 

Another example the book provides is antibiotics in livestock.  For years we dumped antibiotics in livestock to keep them safe however over time, that has developed many new bacteria that are antibiotic resistant. If this had been considered early on, it may have been avoidable given it is a second order effect. 
::: warning A Word of Caution
We need to be careful not to follow the slippery slope argument too seriously here - Slippery slopes generally go so extreme to assume that humans have no rational thought which is far from the truth.  
:::
### Where could this be applied? 

- **Building Trust** -> When considering whether to swindle or build trust, it is worth thinking about the second order effects.  If one were to swindle, the swindlee would no longer interact with the person again.  If they engage in a trust building deal, then many deals are likely to follow.  

- **Leadership** -> When making decisions for organizations, thoughts about actions being taken need to consider second order effects. For example, if we re-org this way, how will it impact communication in the organization? How will it impact trust between divisions?
