# The Great Mental Models - General Thinking Concepts
This book discusses common concepts that we can apply to daily situations in the world around us.  It builds out and encourages one to attempt to better understand the world around them through these frameworks. 

This book was recommended to me by a coworker after a conversation around building out frameworks for solving and approaching problems as well as thinking about things.

## The Map Is Not The Terrain
::: tip Core Concept
Maps are necessary distillations of reality. 
:::

When you see an explanation of something it has necessary simplifications to share the concept. There is likely far more breadth and depth to issues. 

### Concrete Examples
- Subway Map -> Only shows the subway lines, not all of the underground infrastructure such as pipes, etc
- Google Maps -> Doesn't show powerlines, etc because its not an issue for drivers


### Where could this be applied? 

- News Stories -> News is necessary distillation of everything happening in the world. If we did record everything that happened we'd need a really good simulation engine :smile:
- Software Engineering -> We have simplified models of how software works that, most of the time, ignores abstractions associated with processors, machine code and memory management. 
- Stories shared -> If someone is to tell you about their trip to the grocery store, they'll probably skip over parts they deem irrelevant, such as locking or unlocking the door to their home. 
- Carpentry -> I don't need to understand _why_ hardwoods behave the way they do, rather a book on carpentry will just describe the properties. 

## Circle of Competence

::: tip Core Concept
You have things you're good at and things you're not. Be aware of that.

Aside: Its ok to not be an expert at everything or to know everything.
:::

### Concrete Example
The book uses the example of a long time resident of a small town contrasted against a traveler.  The long time resident will understand the intricacies of the social dynamics in the town, the impact of the terrain (near a river), etc.  A traveler who stays a day may know the map but not understand everything about the terrain.

The dangerous place is where the Traveler acts like an expert on the town and starts selling next the river which easily floods. 


### Where could this be applied? 
- What your organization is good at -> If I work for McDonalds and want to start offering low volume, high cost five start dinners I'm likely outside of my circle of competence. 
- Ask for help -> Everyone's going to need help in various places. 
- Impostor Syndrome -> If you feel like an impostor its likely because you do understand
