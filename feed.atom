        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Python + Django is a great development experience, but unfortunately, dependency managment leaves a lot to be desired (though a lot is solved with Virtualenv - If you haven't seen that before, check it out!).  You can very quickly end up in odd states (particularly on a Mac with the system provided version of Python).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This semester Iâ€™m taking a Computer Security course. So far weâ€™ve discussed OS security features, storage features, and buffer overflow attacks.  While listening to a lecture on return oriented programming I was reminded of this challenge. Though I was too busy to partake while it was happening, I was glad to see it is still available to complete. Below I catalog the challenges and how I approached them. Feel free to comment with any questions and I can try to clarify!]]></summary>

While transitioning jobs, I have found that some or all of the following questions help ease me in to the new role.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by cars. Well, really vehicles in general.  The fact that people have figured out how to get thousands of distinct pieces to function together well enough to trust it with our safety astounds me. In this fascination, I decided I wanted to a dig a bit deeper into how a car actually functions.  Of course, thereâ€™s the engine, the drivetrain, the brakes, etc but the question I asked, being a Computer Science student, is how it all fits together. So the real question is, â€œHow do the brakes, engine, air-conditioning, engine, exhaust, air-intake, locks, dashboard, and 50 other things all talk to each other?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Throughout the years my website has taken a number of forms.  First it was a baremetal wordpress site, deployed on my own ESXi server.  Next, I containerized it, deploying in a dockerized version of my baremetal server. Over that time I really enjoyed running Wordpress and a server but I eventually got the point where I found myself avoiding writing to avoid dealing with the maintenance.  After considerable deliberation, I eventually landed on an architecture that I call Zero Maintenance Blogging.]]></summary>
