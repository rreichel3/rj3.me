Feel free to comment with any questions and I can try to clarify!",

The fact that people have figured out how to get thousands of distinct pieces to function together well enough to trust it with our safety astounds me. In this fascination, I decided I wanted to a dig a bit deeper into how a car actually functions.  Of course, thereâ€™s the engine, the drivetrain, the brakes, etc but the question I asked, being a Computer Science student, is how it all fits together. So the real question is, â€œHow do the brakes, engine, air-conditioning, engine, exhaust, air-intake, locks, dashboard, and 50 other things all talk to each other?",

Next, I containerized it, deploying in a dockerized version of my baremetal server. Over that time I really enjoyed running Wordpress and a server but I eventually got the point where I found myself avoiding writing to avoid dealing with the maintenance.  After considerable deliberation, I eventually landed on an architecture that I call Zero Maintenance Blogging.",
